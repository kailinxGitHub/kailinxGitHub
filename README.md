### Hi there 👋
👋 Hey there! I'm a rising Freshman at Northeastern University Khoury College of Computer Sciences, eager to embark on an exciting academic journey to deepen my knowledge of computer science and related fields. 💻🚀

I'm passionate about exploring new things while connecting my interests and passions, from computer hardware and software to blending technology and entrepreneurship.🌟👨‍💼

And hey, the most important lesson I've learned is to never stay in one place! I love intellectual exploration and, let's be honest, who doesn't enjoy a bit of physical travel too? 😄✈️
